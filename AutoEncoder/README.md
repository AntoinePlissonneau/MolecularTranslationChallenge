# AutoEncoder

You will find in this directory the scripts allowing to train an AutoEncoder based on Unet architecture whose goal is to remove the disturbances on the images of molecules, to give color to the molecules, and to reconstruct the missing bonds.

This AutoEncoder facilitates the work of the YOLO algorithm and the attention mechanism developed in parallel.
